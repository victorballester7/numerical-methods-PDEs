# Numerical methods for PDEs

In this repository, I will upload the codes I write for the course "Numerical methods for deterministic and stochastic problems" taught at Dauphine University. The course was divided into three parts:

- Finite differences methods for PDEs, Finite Element Methods (FEM) and Spectral methods
- Monte Carlo methods for PDEs
- Machine learning techniques for PDEs
