    "# Tutorial. Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "A general technique for solving problems with partial differential equations (PDE) that involve a time variable $t$ and one or more space variables is the so-called [method of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines). It proceeds by first discretising the partial derivatives with respect to the space variables and leaving the time variable continuous, leadind to an approximating system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in the variable $t$. The Cauchy problem for the resulting ordinary differential equations is then solved using a standard method for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convenience and versatility of readily available ordinary differential equation solvers permits complicated partial differential equations to be solved with comparative ease in this manner, especially when there is only one space variable. Note that it might well be more efficient to solve a given partial differential equation by a method particularly suited to the equation, but the easy solution of rather general problems with acceptable accuracy makes the approach of the method of lines attractive.\n",

As a consequence, a one-step method is needed to compute approximations to the two missing starting values.

Note that using the less accurate explicit Euler method would lead to an effective decrease in order."
