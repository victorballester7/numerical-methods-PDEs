    "In physics, a <i>conservation law</i> states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include conservation of mass and energy, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of electric charge. It is usually expressed mathematically as a partial differential equation which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the \"transport\" of that quantity. It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.\n",
